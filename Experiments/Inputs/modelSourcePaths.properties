# Customise the property entries as needed for your model; see the JSIT
# User's Guide for more details.
#
# ModelVersionFileDir: path from runtime working directory to the directory
# holding your model version file
#
# SimSourcePath: path from runtime working directory to the directories
# containing your model's source code (which may include libraries, and may
# include files not under version-control; see the JSIT User Guide).
# Omit this property if you don't want JSIT to check whether this source exists
# and has been altered at run-time. This entry can include multiple directories
# separated by semi-colons (on Windows) or colons (on Linux), as per a standard
# path specification.
#
# NB: Forward slashes can be used on Windows as well as Linux. (Java converts
# them to the appropriate OS-specific separators.)
