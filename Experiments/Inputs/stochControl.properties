# This is a Java properties file with format [property name] = [value]
#
# Currently the only permissible settings (values) are:
# NORMAL (normal sampling)
# COLLAPSE_MID (collapse to the 'midpoint', normally the mean)
#
# Settings can be given for all distributions (using ALL), all
# distributions used by a class (using, e.g., Component1.ALL), or
# named distributions per class (using, e.g., Component1.Distribution1)
# The distribution names (IDs) are as specified when the distribution is
# registered with JSIT within model initialisation.
#
# Settings are applied in order so, for example, you can set ALL to
# COLLAPSE_MID and then override specific distributions to be NORMAL.
#
# Some examples are as below (include without the # commment character)
#ALL = NORMAL
#Component1.ALL = COLLAPSE_MID
#Component2.Distribution1 = COLLAPSE_MID
#
HeatBugs.bugInitWidth = COLLAPSE_MID
